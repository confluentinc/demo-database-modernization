# Streaming to Cloud Databases with Confluent

Amid unprecedented volumes of data being generated, organizations need to harness the value of their data from heterogeneous systems in real time. However, on-prem databases are slow, rigid, and expensive to maintain, limiting the speed at which businesses can scale and drive innovation. Today’s organizations need scalable, cloud-native databases with real-time data. This demo walks you through building streaming data pipelines with Confluent Cloud. You’ll learn about:

-Confluent’s fully managed Oracle CDC and RabbitMQ Source connectors to stream customer data and credit card transactions in real time into Confluent Cloud
-ksqlDB to process and enrich data streams in real timem. You'll use aggregates and windowing to create a customer list of potentially stolen credit cards
-A fully managed sink connector to load enriched data into MongoDB Atlas for real-time fraud analysis

Break down data silos and stream on-premises, hybrid, and multicloud data to cloud databases such as MongoDB Atlas, Azure Cosmos DB, DynamoDB and more, so that every system and application has a consistent, up-to-date, and enhanced view of the data at all times. With Confluent streaming data pipelines, you can connect, process, and govern real-time data for all of your databases. Unlock real-time insights, focus on building innovative apps instead of managing databases, and confidently pave a path to cloud migration and transformation.

# Setup

## Set up Local Workstation

The easiest way to run this demo is to launch a preconfigured workspace in Gitpod by clicking this link:
- https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/confluentinc/demo-database-modernization

If you are **not** using Gitpod, then clone this repo and configure your local python environment:

```
git clone https://github.com/confluentinc/demo-database-modernization.git
cd demo-database-modernization
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Set up Confluent Cloud
1. Sign up for a Confluent Cloud account [here](https://www.confluent.io/get-started/).
2. After verifying your email address, access Confluent Cloud sign-in by navigating [here](https://confluent.cloud).
3. When provided with the *username* and *password* prompts, fill in your credentials.
    > **Note:** If you're logging in for the first time you will see a wizard that will walk you through the some tutorials. Minimize this as you will walk through these steps in this guide.

4. Click **+ Add environment**.
    > **Note:** There is a *default* environment ready in your account upon account creation. You can use this *default* environment for the purpose of this demo if you do not wish to create an additional environment.

    * Specify a meaningful `name` for your environment and then click **Create**.
        > **Note:** It will take a few minutes to assign the resources to make this new environment available for use.

5. Now that you have an environment, let's create a cluster. Select **Create Cluster**.
    > **Note**: Confluent Cloud clusters are available in 3 types: **Basic**, **Standard**, and **Dedicated**. Basic is intended for development use cases so you should use that for this demo. Basic clusters only support single zone availability. Standard and Dedicated clusters are intended for production use and support Multi-zone deployments. If you’re interested in learning more about the different types of clusters and their associated features and limits, refer to this [documentation](https://docs.confluent.io/current/cloud/clusters/cluster-types.html).

    * Choose the **Basic** cluster type.

    * Click **Begin Configuration**.

    * Choose **AWS** as your Cloud Provider and your preferred Region. In this demo we use Oregon (West2) as the region. 

    * Specify a meaningful **Cluster Name** and then review the associated *Configuration & Cost*, *Usage Limits*, and *Uptime SLA* before clicking **Launch Cluster**.

### Create an API key pair

## Update Customer Information in Oracle Database
The fully-managed Oracle CDC Source connector for Confluent Cloud captures each change to rows in a database and then represents the changes as change event records in Apache Kafka® topics. You can make changes to the source database (Oracle) and see the updated messages in Confluent Cloud's topic. 

1. Navigate to **confluent.cloud → Topics → ORCL.ADMIN.CUSTOMERS → Messages** and keep the page open to see the update.

1. Run a python script to increase Rica Blaisdell's average credit spend by $1 every 5 seconds. Leave this script running throughout the demo.
    ```
    python oracle/update_user.py
    ```

1. Back in the Confluent Cloud console, verify the Rica Blaisdell's average credit has been updated. 


## Enrich Data Streams with ksqlDB

Now that you have data flowing through Confluent, you can now easily build stream processing applications using ksqlDB. You are able to continuously transform, enrich, join, and aggregate your data using simple SQL syntax. You can gain value from your data directly from Confluent in real-time. Also, ksqlDB is a fully managed service within Confluent Cloud with a 99.9% uptime SLA. You can now focus on developing services and building your data pipeline while letting Confluent manage your resources for you.

If you’re interested in learning more about ksqlDB and the differences between streams and tables, I recommend reading these two blogs [here](https://www.confluent.io/blog/kafka-streams-tables-part-3-event-processing-fundamentals/) and [here](https://www.confluent.io/blog/how-real-time-stream-processing-works-with-ksqldb/) or try different use cases by leveraging existing ksqlDB [recipes](https://developer.confluent.io/tutorials/#explore-top-use-cases). 

1. On the navigation menu click on **ksqlDB** and step into the cluster you created during setup.

    > NOTE: For your convenience, all these persistent queries are available in the file [ksqldb.sql](./confluent/ksqldb.sql). You can paste the entire contents of that file into the editor to save some time.

To write streaming queries against topics, you will need to register the topics with ksqlDB as a stream or table.

2. **VERY IMPORTANT** -- at the bottom of the editor, set `auto.offset.reset` to `earliest`, or enter the statement:
    ```SQL
    SET 'auto.offset.reset' = 'earliest';
    ```
    If you use the default value of `latest`, then ksqlDB will read form the tail of the topics rather than the beginning, which means streams and tables won't have all the data you think they should.

3. Create a ksqlDB stream from `ORCL.ADMIN.CUSTOMERS` topic.
    ```SQL
    CREATE STREAM fd_cust_raw_stream
    WITH (KAFKA_TOPIC = 'ORCL.ADMIN.CUSTOMERS',
          VALUE_FORMAT = 'JSON_SR');
    ```

4. Use the following statement to query `fd_cust_raw_stream` stream to ensure it's being populated correctly.
    ```SQL
    SELECT * FROM fd_cust_raw_stream EMIT CHANGES;
    ```
    Stop the running query by clicking on **Stop**.

5. Create `fd_customers` table based on the `fd_cust_raw_stream` stream you just created. 
    ```SQL
    CREATE TABLE fd_customers WITH (FORMAT='JSON_SR') AS 
        SELECT id                         AS customer_id,
            LATEST_BY_OFFSET(first_name)  AS first_name,
            LATEST_BY_OFFSET(last_name)   AS last_name,
            LATEST_BY_OFFSET(dob)         AS dob,
            LATEST_BY_OFFSET(email)       AS email,
            LATEST_BY_OFFSET(avg_credit_spend) AS avg_credit_spend
        FROM    fd_cust_raw_stream 
        GROUP BY id;
    ```

6. Use the following statement to query `fd_customers` table to ensure it's being populated correctly.
    ```SQL
    SELECT * FROM fd_customers;
    ```
    Stop the running query by clicking on **Stop**.

7. Create the stream of transactions from `rabbitmq_transactions` topic.
    ```SQL
    CREATE STREAM fd_transactions(
        userid DOUBLE,
        transaction_timestamp VARCHAR,
        amount DOUBLE,
        ip_address VARCHAR,
        transaction_id INTEGER,
        credit_card_number VARCHAR
        )
    WITH(KAFKA_TOPIC='rabbitmq_transactions',
         KEY_FORMAT='JSON',
         VALUE_FORMAT='JSON',
         timestamp ='transaction_timestamp',
         timestamp_format = 'yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss');
    ```
9. Use the following statement to query `fd_transactions` stream to ensure it's being populated correctly.
    ```SQL
    SELECT * FROM fd_transactions EMIT CHANGES;
    ```
    Stop the running query by clicking on **Stop**.

11. Join the transactions streams to customer information table.
    ```SQL
    CREATE STREAM fd_transactions_enriched
    WITH (KAFKA_TOPIC = 'transactions_enriched')
    AS SELECT
        T.USERID,
        T.CREDIT_CARD_NUMBER,
        T.AMOUNT,
        T.TRANSACTION_TIMESTAMP,
        C.FIRST_NAME + ' ' + C.LAST_NAME AS FULL_NAME,
        C.AVG_CREDIT_SPEND,
        C.EMAIL
    FROM fd_transactions T
    INNER JOIN fd_customers C
    ON T.USERID = C.CUSTOMER_ID;
    ```

12. Use the following statement to query `fd_transactions_enriched` stream to ensure it's being populated correctly.
    ```SQL
    SELECT * FROM fd_transactions_enriched EMIT CHANGES;
    ```
    Stop the running query by clicking on **Stop**.

14. Aggregate the stream of transactions for each account ID using a two-hour tumbling window, and filter for accounts in which the total spend in a two-hour period is greater than the customer’s average.
    ```SQL
    CREATE TABLE fd_possible_stolen_card
    WITH (KAFKA_TOPIC = 'FD_possible_stolen_card',
          KEY_FORMAT = 'JSON',
          VALUE_FORMAT='JSON')
    AS SELECT
        TIMESTAMPTOSTRING(WINDOWSTART, 'yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss') AS WINDOW_START,
        T.USERID,
        T.CREDIT_CARD_NUMBER,
        T.FULL_NAME,
        T.EMAIL,
        T.TRANSACTION_TIMESTAMP,
        SUM(T.AMOUNT) AS TOTAL_CREDIT_SPEND,
        MAX(T.AVG_CREDIT_SPEND) AS AVG_CREDIT_SPEND
    FROM fd_transactions_enriched T
    WINDOW TUMBLING (SIZE 2 HOURS)
    GROUP BY T.USERID, T.CREDIT_CARD_NUMBER, T.FULL_NAME, T.EMAIL, T.TRANSACTION_TIMESTAMP
    HAVING SUM(T.AMOUNT) > MAX(T.AVG_CREDIT_SPEND);
    ```
15. Use the following statement to query `fd_possible_stolen_card` table to ensure it's being populated correctly.
    ```SQL
    SELECT * FROM fd_possible_stolen_card;
    ```

## Confluent Cloud Stream Governance

Confluent offers data governance tools such as Stream Quality, Stream Catalog, and Stream Lineage in a package called Stream Governance. These features ensure your data is high quality, observable and discoverable. Learn more about **Stream Governance** [here](https://www.confluent.io/product/stream-governance/) and refer to the [docs](https://docs.confluent.io/cloud/current/stream-governance/overview.html) page for detailed information. 

1. Navigate to https://confluent.cloud
2. Use the left hand-side menu and click on **Stream Lineage**. 
Stream lineage provides a graphical UI of the end to end flow of your data. Both from the a bird’s eye view and drill-down magnification for answering questions like:
    * Where did data come from?
    * Where is it going?
    * Where, when, and how was it transformed?
In the bird's eye view you see how one stream feeds into another one. As your pipeline grows and becomes more complex, you can use Stream lineage to debug and see where things go wrong and break.
